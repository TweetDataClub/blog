title: "9 Weeks of Trump Tweet Markets: What do we Know Now?"
---

Since Trump took office on 20 January 2017, nine weeks of PredictIt @realDonaldTrump tweet markets have come and go. Here's what we've seen so far.

| Series | Start Date | End Date | Range Start | Winner Lower | Winner Upper | Range Shift |

| 1      | 25-Jan     | 1-Feb    | 34,368      | 40           | 44           | 43          |

| 6      | 1-Mar      | 8-Mar    | 34,549      | 30           | 34           | 33          |
| 7      | 8-Mar      | 15-Mar   | 34,582      | 20           | 24           | 22          |
| 8      | 15-Mar     | 22-Mar   | 34,604      | 30           | 34           | 33          |
| 9      | 22-Mar     | 29-Mar   | 34,637      | 25           | 29           | 28          |

So far, the PredictIt count has been betwen 24 and 44 each week and, on average, @realDonaldTrump nets 33 tweets per week. However, that number has come down in the most recent 6 weeks (starting with the 15 Feb. market). Here's the trend:

@realDonaldTrump's average net tweet count over that last six-week timeframe is 28.

Because of this, we would expect to see the 25-29 and the 30-34 buckets as the most expensive brackets at the beginning of each week, on roughly equal footing. This has been true for most of the last 6 weeks, but not in the Feb. 22 to Mar. 1 and the Mar. 1 to Mar. 8 markets. In those weeks, Bucket 20-24 was priced higher. (E.g., It closed above Buckets 25-29 and 30-34 on day 1 of trading in both weeks). Maybe this is because the previous week, Feb. 15 to Feb. 22, was such a drop off from the prior weeks. The upshot for bettors is that the market may overreact to the most **recent** weeks' trend.
