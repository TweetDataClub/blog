title: On Which Weekdays does Trump Tweet Most?
---

Does Trump tweet more on certain days of the week? He does, but the effect is smaller than you might think:

As with our [last post](when-tweet), "All Time" refers to all tweets since January 25 2017, and "L3W" refers to tweets over the last three weeks (March 8 to March 29, 2017). Because the PredictIt @realDonaldTrump market open at 12 noon on Wednesdays, "Day 0" is the 24 hour period from noon Wednesday to noon Thursday each week. Similarly for the other days.

On the whole, Trump tweets more on the weekdays than he does on the weekends. (This is roughly Days 3 and 4 above, the period from noon Saturday to noon Monday.) However, the effect doesn't seem that strong.

The conclusion for prediction markets is that while there are slightly fewer tweets over the weekend, it's hard to bank on this effect. You won't get that much of an edge by baking this in to your predictions.
